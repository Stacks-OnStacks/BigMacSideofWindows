TickITPro: IT Ticketing Application

TickITPro is a RESTful IT Ticketing Application designed for small companies looking for a quick and easy application to track and resolve their IT Issues. 
Employees of the company can create an account to create tickets describing their IT issue.
Employees can also set a higher or lower priority to their ticket in case their issue is urgent or doesn't need to be resolved immediately.
Admin appointed users called 'ITPros' can then confirm created tickets to work on resolving the issue.
Admin Users can add Departments, Subjects, edit User roles or even delete Users.
TickITPro was built with Java 8 and Spring 5 through SpringBoot.
The API also utilizes Spring Security and an AWS PostGreSQL RDS for persistence.
The application was deployed to the web using the Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild AWS Services.
The UI was developed in ReactJS and also leverages the public API Dicebear for randomly generated profile pictures.
