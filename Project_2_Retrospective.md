# Project 2 Retrospective - TickITPro

### Sammy Box:
How do we think we did?
I think we did an excellent job given the constraints that we had and the implementation of the technology that we have to implement. I feel like I could have done more talking ways on the technical aspects, but I answered as best I could when needed.

What would we do differently?
Project-wise, if I had to do it again, I would just get started on the UI side sooner. I was slowed because I was not fulling understanding what we were doing with the new React implementation. I had a brain failure and forgot we had Git on our presentation, so I went into that for some reason. I shouldn't have, really. I would have liked to have gone over our presentations once when we weren't so tired and pushed for time.

### Handerson Coq:
How we think we did:
We did great, specially with the way the front end turned out to be.

What we could have done differently:
more mindful about time - better time management would have probably helped us avoiding working late during the weekend.

### Byron Fedele:
1. Considering the lack of time we had during the workday to work on the project, we handed in a stellar project.

2. I think we couldve split up the work more efficiently, where we divy up the work, sprint, come together, merge and divy again. Maybe it wouldve led to an earlier completion time

### Issiaka Kone:
How do we think we did?
I think we did very good considering the time we had left to work on our UI once we did the change to REACT. Everybody held their own and went the extra mile when it was needed to complete the project.

What would we do differently?
The time management could have been better on our part, but it made it a little more difficult that we just finished learning REACT.

### Caleb Beck:
How did we do:
Given the circumstances of simulatenously learning and implementing new technologies over the course of two weeks, our project really turned out great! We were beset by merge conflicts early on which really stunted our initial progress on both API and UI, so we basically lost 2 days worth of time that we had to make up over this past weekend. Regardless, we pulled through and really produced something great.

What I would do differently:
I would have spent less time trying to program as a 5 person unit, it was a really inefficient practice that might have done more harm than good. I would have tried to delegate more tasks instead of managing everything by myself so as to not overburden myself. I burnout too easily because I cannot let go of the control, and that definitely was a detriment to our progress. My teammates proved that they are more than capable of handling seemingly insurmountable tasks, I need to give them the space to work.
