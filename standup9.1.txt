Standup 9.1 - Big Mac and a Side of Windows 

Sammy Box

we finished the setup for models and repo

Today, we are working on aspects and finishing user services and possibly working on the UI if we want to do initial setup for it.

Struggling with finding time to stay current on this week's material while also finish the project is a challenge, but mostly because of time
